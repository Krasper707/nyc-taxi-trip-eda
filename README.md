# 🗽 NYC Taxi Data Analysis with PySpark

This project analyzes NYC Yellow Taxi trip data using PySpark to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and derive insights on temporal trends and trip patterns.

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project explores and analyzes New York City's Yellow Taxi dataset using PySpark to uncover temporal patterns, trip behaviors, and borough-level insights. It demonstrates the use of distributed data processing to handle large urban mobility datasets.


## 📊 Key Features

- Uses PySpark to handle large-scale data from NYC's Yellow Taxi fleet
- Performs null-checking, outlier filtering, and temporal feature engineering
- Analyzes trip frequency by hour and weekday
- Joins with taxi zone data to analyze common pickup/dropoff zones
- Visualizes patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 🧠 Key Findings

- 🚕 Most rides occur between 6PM–8PM, with a second peak around 8AM.
- 🏙️ Manhattan dominates both pickups and dropoffs, especially Midtown and the Financial District.
- 💸 Average fare per mile is highest late at night, suggesting surge or long-haul trips.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **PySpark** for scalable data processing
- **Pandas** for lightweight manipulation
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for visual storytelling
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
